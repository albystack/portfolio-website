## Overview

The **Simple Algorithmic Trading Bot** is a Python-based trading system that uses **moving average crossovers** and **Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals** to execute trades. The bot is backtested on **historical market data** to assess its profitability and risk metrics.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

- Retrieves **historical stock price data** using `yfinance`.
- Computes **technical indicators** such as moving averages and RSI.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def fetch_market_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    stock_data['SMA_50'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    stock_data['SMA_200'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
    stock_data['RSI'] = compute_rsi(stock_data['Close'])
    return stock_data

def compute_rsi(series, period=14):
    delta = series.diff(1)
    gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=period).mean()
    loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=period).mean()
    rs = gain / loss
    return 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
```

### Trading Strategy: Moving Average Crossover & RSI

- **Buy Signal**: When the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA and RSI is below 30.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA and RSI is above 70.

```python
def generate_trading_signals(data):
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data.loc[(data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']) & (data['RSI'] < 30), 'Signal'] = 1  # Buy
    data.loc[(data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200']) & (data['RSI'] > 70), 'Signal'] = -1  # Sell
    return data
```

### Backtesting Strategy

- Simulates trades based on historical data and calculates **PnL (Profit & Loss)**.
- Includes transaction costs and slippage.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data, initial_balance=10000):
    balance = initial_balance
    position = 0
    for index, row in data.iterrows():
        if row['Signal'] == 1:  # Buy
            position = balance / row['Close']
            balance = 0
        elif row['Signal'] == -1 and position > 0:  # Sell
            balance = position * row['Close']
            position = 0
    return balance
```

## Challenges & Learnings

- **False Signals**: Fine-tuned parameters to reduce **whipsaws**.
- **Transaction Costs**: Accounted for **slippage & trading fees**.
- **Optimization**: Used **hyperparameter tuning** for SMA and RSI thresholds.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Train an **AI model** for trade execution.
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Expand to **crypto, forex, and commodities**.
- **Live Trading Deployment**: Connect to a **broker API (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers)**.
