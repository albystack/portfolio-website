## Overview

Machine learning is increasingly being used in quantitative finance to uncover hidden patterns and generate alpha. This project explores **ML-driven alpha generation** by applying **supervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP)** to predict short-term asset price movements.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection & Feature Engineering

- Collected **high-frequency stock data** from Yahoo Finance and Quandl.
- Engineered **alpha factors** such as:
  - **Momentum indicators** (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
  - **Order flow imbalance** (using bid-ask spread data)
  - **Sentiment analysis** (NLP on news headlines and social media data)
  
```python
import yfinance as yf

def fetch_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    df = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date, interval='1m')
    return df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
```

### Supervised Learning Models

- Implemented **Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTMs** to predict future price movements.
- Used **rolling window cross-validation** to prevent overfitting.

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

### Deep Learning (LSTM) for Time Series Prediction

- Used **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** to model sequential price data.
- Optimized using **Adam optimizer and dropout regularization** to prevent overfitting.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(50),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

---

### NLP-Based Sentiment Analysis for Alpha Signals

- Scraped **financial news headlines and tweets** using BeautifulSoup and Tweepy.
- Used **VADER sentiment analysis** to generate a polarity score.

```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    return analyzer.polarity_scores(text)['compound']
```

---

## Backtesting & Performance Evaluation

- Backtested the **ML-based strategy** using historical market data.
- Compared **Sharpe ratio, accuracy, and profit factor** against baseline models.

```python
import pyfolio as pf
returns = strategy_returns - benchmark_returns
pf.create_full_tear_sheet(returns)
```

### Results

#### 1. Strategy Performance

![ML Alpha PnL](../images/ml-alpha-pnl.png)

- ML-enhanced trading signals **outperformed traditional strategies**.
- Combined NLP sentiment signals with price momentum improved **trade execution timing**.

#### 2. Model Accuracy

- XGBoost achieved **68% accuracy** in predicting short-term price moves.
- LSTM models had **higher recall** but required **fine-tuned hyperparameters**.

## Challenges & Learnings

- **Data Overfitting:** Used **feature selection & L2 regularization** to improve generalization.
- **Latency Considerations:** Optimized **real-time prediction speeds** for low-latency execution.
- **Sentiment Noise:** Improved NLP filtering with **TF-IDF weighting** to remove irrelevant text.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Reinforcement Learning Models:** Train **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for trade execution optimization.
- **Multi-Asset Strategy:** Expand model to predict signals across **forex, commodities, and crypto**.
- **Live Trading Integration:** Deploy model on **QuantConnect or Alpaca API** for real-world execution.
